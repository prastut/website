Writing is how I think and this blog is a just a public extension of that process.

## What to Expect

Most of what I want to write about lives under a simple idea: win, and help others win.

I have been thinking about the problem of poverty since childhood. I grew up in India where millions of people apply for a limited number of jobs every year. Hence I have always wanted to build things that generate jobs or, more generally, create wealth in abundance.

Over the last five years, I have been iterating on how to build companies. From everything I have seen, companies still remain the fastest and most scalable mechanism for changing economic outcomes of people in a durable way.

As I figure things out, I want to share what has worked for me.

This blog is part of that process. A ledger of truth-seeking in public, and a collection of notes meant to make the path slightly less opaque for others.
